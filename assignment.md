  * You should have downloaded all source code for ch10 last time
* Change the text on the button and the label

# Activity : Inheritance for Customized Frames

## Objective
* Understand how to create a customized frame with components

## Instructions
* Compare source code for FilledFrameViewer  (`ch10/section_1_2`) with source code for FilledFrameViewer2 and FilledFrame (`ch10/section_1_3`)
  * See if you can articulate the difference between the two strategies (`section_1_2` and `section_1_3`)
  * Explain why the second strategy (`section_1_3`) might be better.
